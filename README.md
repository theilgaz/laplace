# Laplace Transform

This is a simple implementation of the Laplace Transform in Python. The Laplace Transform is a mathematical operation that transforms a function of time, f(t), into a function of a complex variable, s. The Laplace Transform is defined as:

L{f(t)} = F(s) = ∫[0,∞] f(t) * e^(-s*t) dt

where f(t) is the original function, F(s) is the Laplace Transform of f(t), s is a complex variable, and e is the base of the natural logarithm.

The Laplace Transform is useful in many areas of science and engineering, including control theory, signal processing, and circuit analysis. It allows us to analyze the behavior of systems in the frequency domain, which can be more convenient than the time domain in some cases.
